## One.Beer.Later.

The application we intend to build is to showcase all the CRAFT beer locations in a given area that is searched for by the user. We feel this will be a useful application because of the influx of craft beer to the market. We feel that people would be able to utilize this application when travelling to new cities and looking for popular spots to find their favorite craft brews.
