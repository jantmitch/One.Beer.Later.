# One.Beer.Later.

Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp Final Project

Project Name: One.Beer.Later.

Our Team: -Anthony Mitchell -Jason Paffenback -Taylor Yao

What is this?? The idea behind this is revamp our first project which creates an easy way for a user to identify places within an  determined area that sell/serve CRAFT beer. The results will be displayed on a map and then the user will have the option of letting the site provide directions.

We will be using passport.js, gitkraken and their product management cards, google maps API's, Beer API, mongoDB, react and others
